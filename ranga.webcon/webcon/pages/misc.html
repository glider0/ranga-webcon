	<div class="tips _tr">Enable this feature to connect to the netkeeper interface without having to synchronize time after booting. If multi-homing is enabled, it will also try to connect to other interfaces whose protocol type is Netkeeper. This feature is not guaranteed to be always successful. This feature only takes effect when the wan interface protocol is set to Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.</div>

	<div class="tips _tr">Flow Offloading can establish a high-speed "bypass" for forwarded traffic, which reduces the CPU overhead caused by forwarding packets and improves network performance at high load. Hardware Flow Offloading is implemented through HW NAT. It is enabled only when Traffic Offloading is enabled, and only supports a small number of chips. This setting only takes effect on devices with a kernel version (see "Ranga Software Version" in "About Ranga") greater than or equal to 4.14.0.&nbsp;<b>This feature and QoS cannot be enabled at the same time!

	<h1 id="p-misc-scdial-title" class="_tr">New continuous catching service</h1>
	<div class="tips _tr">Traditional catching methods require manually telling NSWA Ranga to start the catching server in the web console or command line tool, then dial the number and have a 1 minute timeout. The new persistent catching service does not need to tell NSWA Ranga to start the catching server, you can intercept the PPPoE connection and dial the number. You should add the @interface name to your account after dialing to allow NSWA Ranga to determine the corresponding interface name. Name, NSWA Ranga will establish a connection from the 'netkeeper' interface, this section should be noted for all users who use multi-homing. This feature is not recommended for small memory devices.&nbsp;<b>After modifying this setting, you need to restart NSWA Ranga to take effect.</b></div>

	<h1 id="p-misc-mssclamping-title" class="_tr">TCP maximum segment clamp (MSS clamping)</h1>
	<div class="tips _tr"><b>Recommended. In older versions of NSWA, this feature cannot be turned off and always enabled.</b>&nbsp;Some implementations of PMTU-D attempt to prevent black hole connections and IP fragmentation by inferring the dropping of large payload packets due to MTUs rather than link congestion. Therefore, in order for TCP to work most efficiently, ICMP Type 3 should be allowed. However, many network security devices block all ICMP messages for security, including the ICMP messages necessary to properly operate the PMTU-D. This can cause the connection to complete the TCP three-way handshake correctly, but it will hang or lose performance when transferring data. This feature “clamps” the TCP MSS option in the SYN packet. This MSS option advertises that the far end sends 1460 or fewer TCP segments to prevent black hole connections and IP fragmentation.&nbsp;<b>After modifying this setting, you need to restart NSWA Ranga to take effect.</b></div>
