	<div class="_tr tips">If you need to upload a data file, select it and click the "Upload" button. If the file is too large or too much and exceeds the remaining space of your system, the system may enter protected mode and make the storage space read-only. After you delete some data files, you may need to restart the system to release the protective read-only mode. You must upload a data file that is NOT "PrivacyExtensionEnabled" (the date file contains the username), otherwise you must use the command line tool to upload it.</div>
